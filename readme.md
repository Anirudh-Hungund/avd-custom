# AVD URL Redirect web app


[Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/overview) is a service that automatically builds and deploys full stack web apps to Azure from a code repository. Use this repo with the [quickstart](https://github.com/george-markou/avdurlredirect/generate) to build and customize a new static site that will redirect http requests to the AVD service.
